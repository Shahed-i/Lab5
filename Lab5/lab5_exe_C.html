				<h2>What is full-stack?</h2>
				<p>
					Full-stack development stands at the cutting edge of modern web and
					software development, embodying a comprehensive approach to building
					applications. A full-stack developer is akin to a versatile artisan,
					skilled in both front-end and back-end technologies. They navigate
					with ease through the layers of a technology stack, from crafting
					engaging and intuitive user interfaces to engineering robust and
					efficient server-side logic. With expertise in a range of languages
					and frameworks — from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end, to
					Node.js, Python, or Ruby for the back end — full-stack developers
					offer a unique blend of cross-disciplinary skills. This holistic
					understanding of both client and server sides allows them to see the
					bigger picture, seamlessly integrate various components of an
					application, and ensure a cohesive, functional, and user-friendly
					experience. In an era where technology is rapidly evolving, full-stack
					developers are the agile architects of the web, capable of building
					dynamic and responsive websites, applications, and systems that drive
					modern digital experiences.
